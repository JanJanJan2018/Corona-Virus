Corona Virus gene expressions from liver tumor samples and capillary samples

GSE100509 and two studies GSE89166 and GSE89160 were used and combined to show the microarray gene expression profiles of the corona virus in Middle East Respiratory Syndrome for GSE100509 using microvascular capillaries after 0,12,24,36, and 48 hours compared to mock or control samples in five groups to keep track of each of the five A through E for those time points. The GSE89166 and GSE89160 are the same study but separated so that the liver tumor cells are tested to see how they react in gene expression values when inoculated or infected with the corona virus. There are four samples inoculated with active corona virus and four non-inoculated samples, then two samples that were inoculated with corona virus but also stimulated with an interleukin, and also two samples that were only inoculated with heat inactivated corona virus. These are found at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE89166 , https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE89160 , and https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE100509 for the samples directly. The platforms were combined using only the gene symbol by array ID, then the genes were grouped by gene and the mean taken per gene, and descriptive names added to each sample ID name. The genes had to be grouped because of duplicates in identifying probes on the array machine to a gene from merging.
